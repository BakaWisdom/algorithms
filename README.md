Since solutions can already be found on the internet to all these problems I'm making this code public for the sole purpose of sharing it with future employers.  Please note that if you are find this repo while taking the algorithms course I would ask that you kindly refrain from using this code specifically. Using this code is cheating please do not put me or yourself in a compromising position.

algorithms course
These are many of the programs written in algorithms class.  These are primarily for Khattis problems.
Here is a brief explanation of each of the files

Anagram: checks for number of unique words in provided list
AutoSink: given a directed acyclical graph find the shortest path from a to b
Bank_Queue: Maximize profit by finding most effecient order to evaluate customers given how long they are willing to wait.
Dijkstra: Problem requiring implimentation of Dijkstra's algorithm
NumberTheory: Variety of helper methods used to impliment RSA
RainbowConnection: Find optimal route where each day you travel as close to a specific distance as possible
Rumormill: given friendships and the person starting the rumor find the order that people hear it. https://utah.kattis.com/problems/utah.rumormill
Spiderman: spidermans workout find minimum height going up or down on set lengths in a set order without ever going below zero and ending the workout at zero
